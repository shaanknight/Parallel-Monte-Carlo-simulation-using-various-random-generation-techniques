We aim to show that the area for any bounded convex shape can be estimated using Monte
Carlo Simulation . We necessarily aim to explore shapes in only 2 dimensions. The only
requirement is probably the availability of a test function for checking given any point
whether it lies inside the shape or not. Also if we do possess an analytical or mathematical
way of figuring out the area, we can make comparision checks between the given areas, one
estimated by Monte Carlo method, other given by the analytical formula .

Since the requirement of test function isn’t well suited for all convex shapes, we focus
our attention on 2 shapes particularly, first , a convex polygon and second, a regular ellipse.

We run parallel Monte Carlo Simulations for measuring the area of close bounded figure using random numbers generated by various algorithms under study :

- Lehmer random number generator
- BSD libc LCG
- MRG given by L’Ecuyer, Blouin and Couture (1993)
- L’Ecuyer’s Multiple Recursive Generator MRG32k3a
- Chiang’s Multiple Recursive Generator

All the details in the study regarding algortihm, implementation and benchmarking can be found in the pdf Parallel_Monte_Carlo_Simulation_with_various_random_number_generation_techniques.pdf .

### Compile instructions 
```sh
mpic++ program.cpp
```

Note that various programs have been created corresponding to the random generation technique and the application (Area of ellipse / Area of polygon), all the parallel programs are to be compiled this way.

### Run instructions
```sh
mpirun -np <numprocs> ./a.out <input_file>
```

Note : the instructors are for parallel programs, not the sequential ones.
